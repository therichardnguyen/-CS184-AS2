Description:
-Hitting 'w' will center on the cursor is and zoom out
-Hitting 't' will center on the cursor and zoom in
-Hitting 'c' will reset the canvas to the original size and position
-Hitting 'shift-a' will output 100 .bmp files of 100 steps of the morph in reverse order (to make a looping gif)
-Hitting 'r' will reset the polygon, effectively undoing the modification
-Hitting 'o' will turn on/off the coordinates of picked vertices
-Hitting 'v' will turn on/off picking circles which will allow users to view vertices and see the picking areas for each vertex
-When dragging, the polygon will make sure that it doesn't leave the area of the canvas so that users can keep picking up the vertices.  
-Users can select a group of vertices by drag-selecting multiple vertices
-resizing will center the canvas
